# carma-analytics-fotda
CARMA Analytics is a secure, scalable and cloud agnostic data architecture to enable research analysis on big data sets by defining repeatable and scalable processes for ingesting data, creation of a data repository to fuse, process and perform quality assurance.  The architecture should also identify the tools required for data analysis for the research teams.  This architecture will address:

Data ingest and transfer:

- Data ingested using a direct connection from a on-prem sandbox (ex. Isilon at TFHRC).

- Data ingested from a remote test environment (ex. using AWS snowball when a direct connection is not available).

- Moving or accessing data from other static and real-time sources to support basic test/dev activities.

Data storage and fusion:

- Storing and fusing of data. 

- Quality assurance.

- Transforming and processing data from disparate static and real-time sources into a format that supports research analysis.

Developer tools and data analytics:

- Provide tools for basic quality assurance and analysis.

- Transferring data to a research analysis environment (the DOT Secure Data Commons)
